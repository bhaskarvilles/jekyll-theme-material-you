    As a highly skilled full stack developer with a specialization in the MERN stack, I have a track record of delivering innovative and high-quality web applications. My expertise in MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js has enabled me to build efficient and scalable systems. I am also well-versed in the latest technologies such as IPFS, IPNS, and multiformats, allowing me to build decentralized applications. Furthermore, I have experience working with SQL and blockchain technologies such as Hyperledger, Filecoin Lotus, Filecoin Venus and web3, as well as cryptography. My background in these technologies, along with my strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail, makes me an ideal candidate for any team working on web development projects.
